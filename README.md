# c_logHelp2

This project comprises the C++ iteration of a REACT project I initiated and which proves necessary for gaining access to the OS file system, searching log data for strings (words), scrubbing lines containing the searched-for word of any sensitive data, and writing the results to file.

The idea originated with a problem I faced in my workplace in which some customers could not share sensitive data even for debugging purposes due to national security interests.
